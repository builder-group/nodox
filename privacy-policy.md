# Privacy Policy for NoDox Chrome Extension

Effective Date: 16 Sep 2024

## Introduction
This privacy policy explains how the NoDox Chrome Extension ("we", "our", or "us") handles your information. We are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring transparency regarding the data collected by the extension. NoDox is designed to blur sensitive information on websites using customizable Regex patterns and does not collect or share personal data.

## Information We Collect
**No Personal Data Collection**:  
NoDox does not collect, store, or transmit any personal information. All data processed by the extension remains entirely within your local browser environment.

### Local Storage
NoDox stores your custom Regex patterns in your browser's local storage. This storage is used solely to enable the extension to apply your personalized blurring rules when you visit websites. This data is not shared or transmitted to any external servers or third parties.

### Permissions
NoDox requires certain permissions to function correctly. Below is a detailed explanation of the permissions requested:

- **Host Permissions (Access to websites you visit)**:  
  NoDox requests access to the content of websites you visit in order to blur sensitive information. This is necessary to identify and modify the text elements on the page based on your Regex patterns. NoDox does not read or store any other content on these websites.
  
- **Storage**:  
  The extension uses local storage to save your preferences and custom Regex patterns, allowing the extension to work according to your settings across sessions.

## Data Sharing and Disclosure
NoDox does **not** share, sell, or transmit any information to third parties. All processes occur locally in your browser, ensuring that no external parties can access your browsing data or personal information.

## Security
We take the security of your information seriously. Since NoDox does not collect or transmit data outside of your local environment, the risk of data breaches or unauthorized access is minimal. However, you should ensure your browser and system are secure by keeping them updated and protected with security software.

## Changes to this Policy
We may update this privacy policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected here, and we will update the "Effective Date" at the top of the policy. We recommend reviewing this policy periodically to stay informed about how NoDox protects your privacy.
